## General
This repo contains the code of the NuGet package [`mu88.Shared`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/mu88.Shared/), providing the following features:
- Add and configure certain OpenTelemetry features (metrics and traces)
- MSBuild target for building multi-platform Docker images using [Microsoft's .NET SDK Container Building Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/docker/publish-as-container)

I use this NuGet package to share features and configurations between different .NET apps, hence avoiding the need to implement it repeatedly.

## Functionality details
### OpenTelemetry
By calling the extension method `ConfigureOpenTelemetry` on an instance of `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder`, the following OpenTelemetry features will be enabled:
- Metrics
¬† - ASP.NET Core (e.g. request duration) ‚Üí [see here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore#metrics)
¬† - .NET process information (e.g. process memory) ‚Üí [see here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Process#metrics)
¬† - .NET runtime information (e.g. GC heap size) ‚Üí [see here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime#metrics)
- Tracing
¬† - ASP.NET Core ‚Üí [see here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore#traces)
¬† - Entity Framework Core ‚Üí [see here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.EntityFrameworkCore)

To export these data, the .NET configuration parameter `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` for the OpenTelemetry endpoint receiving the exported metrics and traces must be configured, e.g. via an environment variable. [See the official OpenTelemetry docs for more information](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/#otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint).

### Multi-platform Docker image
With .NET 8, the support for building Docker images without `Dockerfile`s has been integrated into the .NET SDK. However, it is not (yet ü´∞üèª) possible to build [multi-platform Docker images](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/), i.e. a single Docker image built with the .NET SDK Container Building Tools can one target a single platform (e.g. either `arm64` or `x64`). ¬†
[The GitHub issue "Design multi-manifest (aka multi-architecture or multi-RID) publishing"](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk-container-builds/issues/87) tracks the process of adding this functionality to the .NET SDK. Furthermore, it also contains a very first draft of MSBuild logic on how it could work (kudos to the user [baronfel](https://github.com/baronfel)). As it's quite a lot of lines, I integrated it into this NuGet package and therefore can reuse it easily.

#### Usage
By installing the NuGet package, the MSBuild project `mu88.Shared.targets` will be added to the .NET project ([see here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/msbuild-props-and-targets)) and the target `MultiArchPublish` will become available which can be called like this:

`dotnet publish MyProject.csproj /t:MultiArchPublish '-p:ContainerImageTags="dev"' '-p:RuntimeIdentifiers="linux-amd64;linux-arm64"' -p:ContainerRegistry=registry.hub.docker.com`

This command will do the following:
- Build the .NET project `MyProject.csproj` for both `arm64` and `amd64` targeting Linux.
- Build and publish a Docker image per platform to the official Docker registry, i.e. there you will see two tags `dev-arm64` and `dev-amd64`.
- Publish a Docker image with tag `dev` using a new Docker manifest combining both `dev-arm64` and `dev-amd64`.

The detour of pushing two platform-specific Docker images to the registry first and combining it afterward into a multi-platform image is a limitation of the current approach.
